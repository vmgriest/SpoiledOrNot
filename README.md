An AI-powered computer vision project that classifies food items as fresh or spoiled using deep learning. Built with transfer learning and state-of-the-art CNN architectures, this system can help reduce food waste and prevent foodborne illnesses by providing quick, automated freshness assessment.
✨ Features

    Multi-Food Classification: Detects freshness across various food categories including fruits, vegetables, and meats

    High Accuracy: Achieves up to 97-99% accuracy on test datasets using transfer learning

    Real-time Prediction: Can process single images or real-time camera feed

    Confidence Scores: Provides probability scores for predictions

🧠 How It Works

SpoiledOrNot uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with transfer learning to analyze visual features that indicate freshness:

    Fresh foods: Vibrant colors, firm texture, natural appearance

    Spoiled foods: Dullness, mold spots, discoloration, wilting, bruising

The model is trained on curated datasets of fresh and spoiled food images, learning to distinguish subtle visual cues that indicate edibility.
